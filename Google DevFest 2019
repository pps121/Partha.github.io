A Sprite for TechMakers:

I am really grateful for getting selected as a Google Developers’ member to attend this event. 
It was an amazing meetup. Two speakers were from google brain, 15+ speakers from the community and industry along with the 1000+ community members.

The talks were the need of the hour and with trending tracks including AI/ML, cloud, mobile, web, pro and grow your career sessions. I have learned many things from these sessions & keynote speeches. Thank you very much, Google!

WoW moments

Ofcourse, the awesome cool goodies from Google. 
To end with an important line:
“Education is the passport to the future for tomorrow, Prepare it today”.
